Units of Measurement

# Objective

1. Relate [units of measurement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_of_measurement) to the [International System of Units (SI)](https://www.bipm.org/en/measurement-units/) to define their dimension and magnitude.
2. Relate arbitrary objects to units.

# Motivation

First, I used the library [`forallpeople`](https://github.com/connorferster/forallpeople), but that ran into [issues with large scales](https://github.com/connorferster/forallpeople/issues/27) like Megatonnes and Gigatonnes.

Based on my [objectives](#objective) I decided to create a new library that does exactly that and does not deal with quantities (yet).
